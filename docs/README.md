# Developer docs

Living maps of the codebase, so you (or an AI) can find "where does X live / how does Y flow" without re-reading the whole tree. These are **reference maps**, not rules — for working conventions (dev loop, Server Action template, migration workflow, smoke protocol) see [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md).

## How to use these

- Each doc is anchored to real `file.ts:line`-style paths. When you change something a doc describes, update the doc in the same change.
- Keep entries terse and skimmable (tables, bullets). Add a note whenever you learn something non-obvious that the next person would otherwise rediscover the hard way.
- Don't duplicate `CLAUDE.md` or `OPERATIONS.md` — link to them.

## Index

| Doc | What it covers |
|---|---|
| [data-model.md](data-model.md) | DB tables, the core domain graph, key columns & the non-obvious ones (derived `rpe`, type override, peak anchors) |
| [workout-and-sets.md](workout-and-sets.md) | Program set (blueprint) vs logged set, the SetEditView's two modes, RIR (logged vs target), exercise type, failed sets, how effort feeds progression |
| [cycles-and-plans.md](cycles-and-plans.md) | Training cycles & slots, the triathlon plan generator (Workout A/B + endurance week), periodization & no-wearable adaptation |
| [gotchas.md](gotchas.md) | The traps that bit us — Turbopack cache corruption, local-DB migration, fail-safes for deleted entities, E2E creds |
| [OPERATIONS.md](OPERATIONS.md) | Prod ops runbook (health probes, boot order, env, rate limits) |

## Conventions recap (the short version — full text in CLAUDE.md)

- **Server Components fetch, Server Actions mutate.** Every action starts with `requireSession()`/`requireAdmin()` and filters by `userId` (or `assertOwner`). Never accept `userId` as a param.
- **Types are inferred from Drizzle** (`typeof table.$inferSelect`) — never hand-written.
- **Migrations are committed SQL** in `drizzle/`; never generated at build time. Schema change → `pnpm db:generate` → commit the `.sql` + `meta/` snapshot together.
- **Dev runs in Docker** (`./scripts/dev.sh`); tests run locally (`pnpm test`); gate with `pnpm verify` before calling a task done.
