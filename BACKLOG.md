# BACKLOG

Anything Claude (or anyone) leaves unfinished, partially implemented, or explicitly defers goes here. Each entry: what, why deferred, what would unblock it, where the relevant code lives.

Don't put work-in-progress here. WIP belongs on a branch. This is for *known* gaps the team has agreed to leave for later.

When you finish an item, delete it. When you add an item, write enough that someone unfamiliar with the conversation can pick it up.

## Smart-progression UX

### Skip suggestion compute for completed sets
- **What:** In `getProgressiveSuggestions`, skip program sets whose corresponding `workoutSet.isCompleted = true` in the active session.
- **Why deferred:** Marginal CPU win. UI already hides suggestions for completed sets via `!isCompleted` gate at `WorkoutSetsList.tsx:1042`. Adds a DB query for negligible benefit.
- **Unblocked by:** Profiling that shows suggestion compute is a real bottleneck (unlikely with current dataset sizes).
- **Touchpoints:** `src/lib/actions/workout-sets.ts:806-826`.

### Per-exercise (not per-set) progression UI
- **What:** Collapse the per-set `↑ Xkg` badges into one affordance per exercise: "↑ all working sets to 82.5 kg". Today, applying a suggestion propagates across siblings, but the badges still render per-set.
- **Why deferred:** Bigger UX redesign than the recent rounds covered. Hold until you've used the current per-set badges for a while and confirmed the clutter is real.
- **Unblocked by:** Concrete user feedback that the per-set badges are still too noisy now that warm-ups are filtered and the apply propagates.
- **Touchpoints:** `src/components/features/WorkoutSetsList.tsx:1040-1207`.

### `latest.weightKg` vs program-planned weight quirk
- **What:** `buildSuggestion` uses `latest.weightKg` from history as `baseWeight` (`src/lib/utils/progression.ts:219`), not the program's planned weight. If a user logs a one-off heavy single, the next suggestion is built off that single — which then usually shows "held" because the consensus gate kicks in. Surprising in edge cases.
- **Why deferred:** Rare in practice; the consensus gate masks most surprise. Tier 1 changes don't make it worse.
- **Unblocked by:** A user reporting concrete confusion.
- **Touchpoints:** `src/lib/utils/progression.ts:218-219`.

## Codebase hygiene

### Out-of-app push notifications via Service Worker
- **What:** `src/lib/notifications.ts:33` has a `TODO`. Today the app uses the browser Notification API (in-app only). Real out-of-app push needs a Service Worker registration + `pushManager.subscribe()` + server-side delivery.
- **Why deferred:** Not blocking any current flow.
- **Unblocked by:** Product decision that out-of-app push is needed.
- **Touchpoints:** `src/lib/notifications.ts`.
