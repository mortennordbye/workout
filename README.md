# LogEveryLift

**A mobile-first Workout Tracking PWA built with Next.js 16 (App Router).**
Designed to feel like a native iOS app. Runs in Docker containers for environment consistency.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker Desktop

### Start Development
```bash
./scripts/dev.sh
```
- App: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- Health: [http://localhost:3000/api/health](http://localhost:3000/api/health)

### Common Commands

```bash
# Database
docker-compose exec app pnpm db:push       # Push schema changes
docker-compose exec app pnpm db:seed       # Seed exercise library + demo user
docker-compose exec app pnpm db:seed-fake  # Populate demo user with realistic test data
docker-compose exec app pnpm db:reset-user # Wipe all user data (keeps exercises + user record)
docker-compose exec app pnpm db:studio     # Open Drizzle Studio
docker-compose exec app pnpm db:migrate    # Run migrations (prod)

# Quality
docker-compose exec app pnpm lint          # ESLint
docker-compose exec app pnpm build         # Production build check

# Tests (run locally — no Docker needed)
pnpm test                                  # Run all tests once
pnpm test:watch                            # Watch mode
```

### Test data

`db:seed-fake` populates the demo user (id=1) with:
- 2 programs ("Push Pull Legs A" and "Upper Body") with planned exercises and sets
- An active 12-week training cycle with Mon/Wed/Fri slots
- ~12 completed workout sessions spread over the past 4 weeks

```bash
# Populate
docker-compose exec app pnpm db:seed-fake

# Overwrite existing data
docker-compose exec app pnpm db:seed-fake --force

# Wipe everything and start fresh
docker-compose exec app pnpm db:reset-user
```

### Dev Script Options

```bash
./scripts/dev.sh              # Start dev environment
./scripts/dev.sh --test       # Run tests before starting
./scripts/dev.sh --prod       # Build and run production image
./scripts/dev.sh --skip-build # Skip Docker image rebuild
./scripts/dev.sh --clean      # Force clean build (no cache)
./scripts/dev.sh --logs       # Attach to logs only
```

| Concern | Tool |
| --- | --- |
| **Framework** | Next.js 16 — App Router, React Server Components |
| **Language** | TypeScript (Strict Mode) |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL 16 (Dockerized) |
| **ORM** | Drizzle ORM |
| **Authentication** | Better Auth |
| **Validation** | Zod — required on all Server Actions |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS 4 |
| **UI** | shadcn/ui + Lucide React |
| **PWA** | Serwist (Service Workers) |
| **Testing** | Vitest |

## 📐 Development Guidelines

### Data & State
- **Server Components** for all data fetching — never fetch in Client Components unless required for interactivity
- **Server Actions** for all mutations — no REST routes for CRUD
- **Zod validation** on every Server Action before touching the database
- **Local state** (`useState`) only for UI interaction — no Redux/Zustand

### UI & Mobile-First
- Every screen must feel like a native iOS app (fixed headers, bottom nav)
- Touch targets minimum **44×44px**
- Use `:active` for tap feedback, not `:hover`
- Primary actions go in pinned bottom bars
- Destructive actions at the bottom of the screen

### Code Quality
- **Reuse before adding** — always check for existing components, hooks, and utilities before writing new ones. The feature-component split and `src/lib/utils/` exist for this reason. Adding a duplicate `formatTime` or a second picker modal is worse than importing the shared one.
- **No dead code** — if a button has no `onClick`, remove it or implement it. Don't leave placeholder UI.
- **No premature abstractions** — don't extract a helper for something used once. Wait until it's needed in two or more places.

## 🗄 Database Schema

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `exercises` | Exercise library (system + custom) |
| `programs` | Workout templates |
| `program_exercises` | Exercises within a program |
| `workout_sessions` | Workout logs (date, duration) |
| `workout_sets` | Sets performed (reps, weight, RPE) |

Types are inferred from Drizzle schema — never define them manually:
```ts
type ProgramSet = typeof programSets.$inferSelect;
```

## 🤖 MCP Server

The app exposes a **Model Context Protocol** endpoint so MCP clients (Claude Desktop/Code, etc.) can read and write your programs, training cycles, and profile/weight on your behalf.

- **Endpoint:** `http://localhost:3000/api/mcp` (Streamable HTTP)
- **Auth:** OAuth via Better Auth's `mcp` plugin. The client runs the OAuth flow against your normal login; the access token is scoped to your user. Discovery metadata lives at `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` and `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`.
- **Scope:** read + write for **programs** (incl. exercises/sets), **training cycles** (incl. slots), and **profile/weight**. `userId` is always taken from the token — never a tool argument — so a client can only ever touch its own data.

**Connect a client** — point it at the endpoint URL and complete the browser OAuth prompt. With the Claude Code CLI:
```bash
claude mcp add --transport http logeverylift http://localhost:3000/api/mcp
```

**Tools** (~13): `list_programs`, `get_program`, `create_program`, `update_program`, `delete_program`, `edit_program_exercise`; `list_training_cycles`, `get_training_cycle`, `manage_training_cycle`, `edit_cycle_slot`; `get_profile`, `update_profile`, `manage_weight`. Tool code lives in `src/lib/mcp/tools/`; the route is `src/app/api/[transport]/route.ts`.

> **Adding npm deps for the dev container:** `node_modules` is an anonymous Docker volume baked from the image, so a host-only `pnpm add` won't reach the running container. After changing dependencies, rebuild: `docker-compose build app && docker-compose up -d --force-recreate --renew-anon-volumes app` (or `./scripts/dev.sh --clean`).

## 📦 Deployment

### Production
```bash
docker build -t workout-pwa:latest .
docker run -p 3000:3000 -e DATABASE_URL=... workout-pwa:latest
```

**Environment variables:**
- `DATABASE_URL` — `postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/db`
- `NODE_ENV` — `development` or `production`
- `NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED` — `1`

## 🧩 Troubleshooting

- **Port 3000 in use:** `lsof -i :3000`
- **DB connection failed:** `docker-compose ps` / `docker-compose logs postgres`
- **Type errors after schema change:** `docker-compose exec app pnpm db:generate`
